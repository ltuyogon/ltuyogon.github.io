        </div>
        <p><b>The Challenge:</b></p>
        <p>In my previous role in a warehouse setting, I handled delivery tracking and communications manually, which sometimes led to missed updates, unclear records, and delays in addressing stock shortages or customer follow-ups.</p>
        <p><b>What I Did:</b></p>
        <p>- Created a structured spreadsheet with columns for delivery status, dates, branch names, PO/Invoice/DR numbers, and remarks.</p>
        <p>- Used checkboxes to visually indicate delivery and return status.</p>
        <p>- Organized a professional inbox using Microsoft Outlook, with folders for Clients, Finance, Training, and Projects.</p>
        <p><b>The Result:</b></p>
        <p>The system made it easier to:</p>
        <p>- Monitor delivery progress and return status at a glance.</p>
        <p>- Transformed a cluttered inbox into a structured workspace, making communication more efficient and task management easier.</p>
        <p>- Strengthened overall workflow by combining logistical tracking with organized digital communication.</p>

      <br><h3>Customer Service (In-Person Experience)</h3>

          <img src="images/customer_support_email.png" alt="Image 4" class="grid-image">
        </div>
        <p><b>The Challenge:</b></p>
        <p>Supporting customers directly meant handling questions, complaints, and requests in real time‚Äîoften without scripts. I had to stay calm, listen actively, and resolve issues on the spot.</p>
        <p><b>What I Did:</b></p>
        <p>- Assisted walk-in customers with inquiries, purchases, and service concerns.</p>
        <p>- Handled complaints professionally, offering solutions and follow-ups.</p>
        <p>- Maintained a friendly, helpful attitude to ensure a positive customer experience.</p>
        <p><b>The Result:</b></p>

      <div class="image-grid">
          <img src="images/jewelry_tracker.png" alt="Image 5" class="grid-image">
        </div>
        <p>In my previous role as a vault keeper, I managed jewelry sales and inventory, tracked outbound and inbound inventory flow, and assisted with in-person customer service. I maintained accurate records, ensured product security, and supported purchases with professionalism and care. These responsibilities translate directly into e-commerce tasks such as inventory tracking, product listing management, and customer support.</p>
