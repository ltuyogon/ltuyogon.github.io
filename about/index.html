    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p class="fade-in">Hi, I'm Leobe! I'm a passionate and detail-oriented Virtual Assistant with a strong foundation in admin support, customer service, and e-commerce assistance. I love helping businesses run smoothly and thrive by taking care of the behind-the-scenes tasks that matter.</p>

    <h3>My VA Journey</h3>
    <p>I started my VA journey with curiosity and the desire to learn something new.</p>
    <p>My journey began when I discovered how virtual assistants can help businesses stay organized and productive from anywhere. That inspired me to start learning tools like Google Workspace, Excel, and to explore how I can apply my skills to support clients online.</p>
    <p>I continuously invest in my learning through free online trainings and YouTube resources about virtual assistance. These have helped me understand the tools, systems, and mindset needed to succeed as a VA.</p>
    <p>As I continue to build my experience, I’m committed to applying what I’ve learned with focus, creativity, and attention to detail. I believe that consistency and a willingness to learn are the keys to achieving great results over time.</p>
    <p>Today I’m bringing my growing skills into the online space through admin support, customer support, e-commerce assistance, basic graphic design, and video editing. Every small project is a chance to improve, and every challenge is an opportunity to learn something new.</p>
